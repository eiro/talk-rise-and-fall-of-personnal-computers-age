## where to find a PC in 80's

    * some rare wealthy neighbors
        Amstrad   CPCs
        Commodore C64
    * schools and computer clubs (mainly)
        TO7-70

## TO7-70

    Motorola 6809E, 1 MHz
    RAM    : 48 Ko
    text   : 40 × 25
    video  : 320 × 200,  16 colors

    software distribution on
    : programs hardcopied on books and magazines
    : audio tapes (sooooo slow ...)

    > social engineering
    > you better write simple softwares
#pause
                 have
                 expect

## Computers where new for everyone

Even for adults. so

we learned by:

    - copying programs from books
    - peer/mob programming/manual reading
    - asking/answering questions

software lifecycle:

    - release soon, release often
    - developpement/usage iterations

Agile methodology is *at least* that old!

##

    Utile     ? fuck yeah!
    Fun       ? it depends
    Social    ? share and tranmit the knowledge
    Desire    ? how do you think it becomes a market ?

## gates and jobs

Gates about sharing
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists

transform a land of freedom to a market

    * stolen all the possible futures and emphasize their poor visions
      to create monocultures
    * proprietary softwares everywhere
    * good/known programming toolchains were unaffordable (borland)
        => pirates and crackers

## linux and internet

    this UNIX (OS of the mainframes)

        => software design by scientists
        => KISS philosophy
        => Perl (C if you need)

    IRC / NNTP Newsgroups / FTP (ls-R.txt)

        => solve the (technical) education of next generations

    Gopher

        * "cool replacement for ftp"
        * "overseeded by WWW"

    WWW

        => i bet no one want to use that ...

## Paychecks and MS domination

First Job

    System administration with MS stack

    * Windows NT4
    * Exchange 5.5
    * Internet Information Server 3.0

    * Webmastering
        prototyping with dreamweaver/photoshop
#pause
        production  with dreamweaver generated code
        (as long as IE renders correctly)

## words of widsom

    "Stop your linux thing, Microsoft won it all"
     -- my former boss

## Applying new jobs

    no txt, no ps, no pdf, not even html:
    doc files (MS word) were standard format for resumes

## Open source returns ...

~ 1995
    HTML < 4 was a doc format (almost no CSS, no JS)

    the IT who setup the http service and wrote a
    makefile to run some perl scripts/m4 macros.
    no form, no behavior.

~ 2000

    LAMP (linux, apache, mysql, PHP)
    then python and now Javascript stack

## software can inspire culture, not fix it

~ 20xx (i really didn't care a this point)

* info became commercials
* inline images on modems
* broken CSS + <table> + containers * 100 =
  the worse publication system ever
* mediocrity becames the norm
* security holes

Webmasters replaced by web teams (front, back, …)

~ 2015

    Revolution: static generation:
    faster, more secure, easier to deploy and maintain

#pause
    the IT who setup the http service and use
    a twisted build system to do the things we did in 90's
    with a perl script.
    *hopefully* less than 2Mb of CSS/JS

## Rise of online services

The battle we lose was the Mozilla configuration panel

    * Forced and uneducated users
    * Overloaded Helpdesks

THE CRITICAL RESSOURCE WAS *EDUCATED* TECHNICIANS TIME

    * don't educate, provide new services/softwares
    * we can buy more servers and softwares
    * what is technical debt anyway

Hosting services

    * No deploy
    * No configuration
    * No freedom
    * No more expectations

## Open source become another tool of control

    => remote hosting
    => web services
    => unnecessary complex technology stacks
    => no more care about software quality
    => no more

# Fixing it the wrong way

   * Industrial virtualization: now your errors can scale
   * Continuous intregration  : be sure we can always add crap

## I gave up long time ago but ...

    * Climate change
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change
    * Biodiversity collapse
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction
    * Raw material shortage
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elements_facing_shortage

    made me stand up and think

    Carbon inequity
        most people in this world just want to eat.

    => Energy transition is bullshit

## Impact of our Digital Lives

    Electronic wastes are huge environemental problems
    Extraction sites and manufacturing is disaster
    Between %2 to %10 of the global energy consumption

    => Life-cycle assessment studies
            are just estimations

    focus on dynamics and order of magnitude

    => WE'RE SCREWED IF WE PERSIST

## the focus

    lower the environemental impact of production
    reduce rotation rate
    choose wisely what we *really* need

## so what ?

Let's face it, no matter their "Digital soberty"

    terminal
    ──────── >= 1
     person

is not affordable in an environmental perspective

* we should go back to clubs and places to share digital lives
* we should come back to "Digital conviviality"

## inspired by Tools of conviviality (Ivan Illich - 1973)

things have to be simple and open source so they can be

    * shared
    * learned by the most
    * masterized by many
    * easy to maintain
    * hard to lose

Software minimalism is not only an esthetic research,
It's a pragmatic attitude to value conviviality
over functionality.

Sounds familliar? Read the Bitreich manifesto!

    Unix is user-friendly — it's just choosy about who its friends are.
        Anonymous, in The Art of UNIX Programming (2003) by Eric S. Raymond

    Whose who don't understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly
        Henry Spencer

## People are scared

* They should be much more scared about the consequences of inaction
* Post personal computing could be

    Utile     ? fuck yeah!
    Fun       ? it depends
    Social    ? share and tranmit the knowledge
    Desire    ? yes because it solves real problems

There will be

    less software, more humans
    less services, more advices

Bitreich could help

* Help leading new generations to Digital Conviviality
* Help preparing/delaying the resilence

    think about their usages
    create tools
    simple ergonomy (yes, i have ideas :))

thanks to the bitreich feebacks, i added added slides about
the "rise and fall of webmasters" because "explicit agreement is better":

* the web it an iconic technology to illustrate how the IT went wrong:
  the bad tool (documentation system) for the wrong strategy (reduce cost)
  so the technical debt exploded and no money were put to fix the
  real problems.
* the web stack by itself demonstrate how hard it is to expect an
  happy end from a story about mistunderstandings and stubborness.
* new generations are born in a broken IT: it is hard to "think different".
